  <option name="DESCRIPTION" value="Wrote a unit test for CourseDAO#squashMap and added null annotations.  A large part of this next sprint is going to be bugfixes so I decided to help out Cam and add nullability checks on all database methods. This will make intellij complain about them. I also noticed that the map  squashing we do in CourseDAO isn't only not tested, but requires some relatively complex logic. I decided to separate it out into its own  method and write a unit test for it." />
