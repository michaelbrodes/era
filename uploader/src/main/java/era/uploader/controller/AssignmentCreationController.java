 * create new qr_code_mappings for those assignments. We need a way for the
 * user to input a course, a way for the user to input an assignment name,
 * and then how many pages will be on that assignment. Currently we have no
 * way to create placeholder assignments (our schema doesn't allow it), so for
 * right now we can skip on that functionality. You will need to
 * refactor {@link era.uploader.service.QRCreationService} to create the
 * qr_code_mappings for you (each student needs to have numPages number of QR
 * code mappings).
